I am a student of Electronics and Communication Engineering department at Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Delhi. My research explores the fascinating area that lies at the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Computational Vision.

I am currently working as a research intern at [CVAI lab](http://www.cvai.cs.uni-frankfurt.de/index.html), Goethe University under Prof. Gemma Roig. During my junior year at NSIT, I split my time studying at NSIT and interning (remotely) at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.
