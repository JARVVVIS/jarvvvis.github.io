  abstract={The utility of aerial imagery (Satellite, Drones) has become an invaluable information source for cross-disciplinary applications, especially for crisis management. Most of the mapping and tracking efforts are manual which is resource-intensive and often lead to delivery delays. Deep Learning methods have boosted the capacity of relief efforts via recognition, detection, and are now being used for non-trivial applications. However the data commonly available is highly imbalanced (similar to other real-life applications) which severely hampers the neural network's capabilities, this reduces robustness and trust. We give an overview on different kinds of techniques being used for handling such extreme settings and present solutions aimed at maximizing performance on minority classes using a diverse set of methods (ranging from architectural tuning to augmentation) which as a combination generalizes for all minority classes. We hope to amplify cross-disciplinary efforts by enhancing model reliability.},

  abstract={The effects of data disparity are well documented,
and there are many proposed methods for handling such biases, however, most are either standalone, domain-specific or unfeasible. In our work
Rawal & Pradhan (2020), we tried to evaluate
parallel efforts for handling class-imbalance, focusing on complementary techniques, to present
modular approaches that optimize performance
for the minority classes. Here, we briefly expand
on the apparently ’vague’ effects of improving robustness for intrinsic generalization. We also shed
light on standard vs metrics and their relations to
the specific type of insights},
